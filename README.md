## Intro
Welcome to my puzzle game!
In this game you will play as the character, Dog, who was tasked with reaching the sixth floor of the Bluemoon HQ to stop a terrorist attack.
You have to use problem solving and logic skills to figure each puzzle out!

## Instructions
Once you run the py file, you will see the start menu. You can choose "Start Game" to immediately begin the game and go into the first level. Alternatively, you can choose "Level Select" to pick any level you want to start on. Or, if you wish, just press "Exit Game" to exit the game.

Once you are on a level, you will see 2 text boxes. The one on the top is the message box. This is where you are given the introduction to a level and told your surroundings. Make sure to read through it!

The bottom box is the hint box. This is where Dog typically talks to himself, but may also give you small hints on how to complete certain puzzles.

On the right of the screen you will see the menu buttons. These are different things you can do in a level and are essentially the puzzles. Clicking on them will do different things, and will send messages in both the message box and hint box. Once again, make sure to read!

At the bottom of the screen you will see the action buttons. These are contextual and depend on what menu button you chose. You will be told what action button does what depending on the menu button. These also will help you solve puzzles.

Once you solve a puzzle, the "Unlock Door" button at the top will enable itself and you can move to the next level!

Additionally there is a menubar at the top where you can return to the start menu or level select, if you need to.

That's all! Good luck and have fun!
